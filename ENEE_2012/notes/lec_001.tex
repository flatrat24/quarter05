\subsection{Categorization of Components}
\label{ssec:categorizationOfComponents}

Rather than trying to understand full circuits at once, it is easier to break them into two groups: \textbf{passive} components and \textbf{active} components.

\begin{definition}{Passive Components}
  Passive components are ones that don't require any power supply to operate. For example, a resistor or a capacitor are both passive components.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Active Circuits}
  Active components require power to operate. In other words, they need to be connected to a power supply to function. Logic gates (74LSXX) are active since they require a power supply.
\end{definition}

Another way to divide components is between \textbf{linear} and \textbf{non-linear}.

\begin{definition}{Linear Components}
  Linear components are... They also can be subdivided into components that store energy (capacitors and inductors) and components that dissipate energy (resistors).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Non-Linear Components}
  ...
\end{definition}

\subsection{Overview of Concepts}
\label{ssec:overviewOfConcepts}

\subsubsection{Charge and Current}
\label{sssec:chargeAndCurrent}

\begin{definition}{Charge}
  Charge ($Q$) is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in coulombs ($C$).
  \begin{equation*}
    Q(t) = \int_{}^{} i(t) \,dt
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

When charged particles move in space over time, such as throughout a wire in a circuit, an electrical current is generated.

\begin{definition}{Electric Current}
  Electric current ($I$) is the time rate of change of charge, measured in amperes ($A$).
  \begin{equation*}
    i(t) = \frac{dQ}{dt}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Current is simply a rate of change of a charge, and thus the two are related as the others' derivative/integral.

\subsubsection{DC vs. AC}
\label{sssec:dcvsac}

\begin{definition}{Direct Current}
  A direct current (dc) flows only in one direction and can be constant or time varying.
\end{definition}

    \label{fig:002}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Electron Flow in Direct Currents}
  \label{fig:electronFlowInDirectCurrent}
\end{wrapfigure}

There are two ways of describing the \textit{direction} in which the electrons flow in a direct current: \textbf{conventional flow} and \textbf{electron flow}. Both are shown in Figure \ref{fig:electronFlowInDirectCurrent}.

\begin{definition}{Alternating Current}
  An alternating current (ac) is a current that changes direction with respect to time.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Voltage}
  Voltage (or \textit{potential difference}) is the energy required to move a unit charge form a reference point (-) to another point (+), measured in Volts ($V$).
  \begin{equation*}
    v(t) = v_b - v_b = \frac{dw}{dQ} = \frac{dE}{dQ}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Power and Energy}
\label{sssec:powerAndEnergy}

\begin{definition}{Power}
  Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy measured in watts ($W$). It is the rate of change of energy.
  \begin{align*}
    p(t) &= \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dE \cdot dQ}{dt \cdot dQ} = \frac{dE}{dQ} \cdot \frac{dQ}{dt} \\
    p    &= v \cdot i
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Energy}
  Energy is the capacity to do work measured in Joules ($J$).
  \begin{equation*}
    E(t) = \int_{}^{} p(t) \, dt
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Again, these two values are related as the derivative/integral of the other.

\subsection{Circuit Elements}
\label{ssec:circuitElements}

\begin{definition}{Ideal Independent Source}
  An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a specified voltage or current that is completely independent of other circuit elements.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Ideal Dependent Source}
  Also called an \textit{Ideal Controlled Source}, this is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
\end{definition}

% TODO: include figures of each type as wrapfig

There are four types of dependent sources:
\begin{enumerate}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS)
  \item Voltage Controlled Current Source (VCCS)
  \item Current Controlled Voltage Source (CCVS)
  \item Current Controlled Current Source (CCCS)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Basic Laws}
\label{ssec:basicLaws}

\subsubsection{Ohm's Law}
\label{sssec:ohmsLaw}

\textbf{Ohm's Law} states that the voltage $V$ across a resistor is \textit{directly} proportional to the current $I$ flowing through the resistor.

\begin{formula}{Ohm's Law}
  \begin{equation*}
    R = \rho \cdot \frac{l}{A}
  \end{equation*}
\end{formula}

When there is current flowing through a wire with resistance approaching zero, a \textbf{short circuit} is created. Conversely, an \textbf{open circuit} is where the resistance in a circuit approaches infinity.

Resistance and conductance are inversely related. It is the ability of an element of conduct electric current; it is measured in mhos or siemens ($S$).

\subsubsection{Nodes, Branches, & Loops}
\label{sssec:nodesBranchesLoops}

\begin{definition}{Branch}
  Represents a single element in a circuit such as a resistor or power supply.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Node}
  The point of connection between two or more branches.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Loop}
  A loop is any \textit{closed} path in a circuit. Generally, loops are defined as the smallest possible path.
\end{definition}

By analyzing the nodes connection branches of a circuit, elements can be found to be in parallel or in series.

\begin{definition}{Parallel}
  Elements are in parallel if they share two nodes.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Series}
  Elements are in series if they \textit{exclusively} share a node.
\end{definition}

It is possible for elements to be neither in series or in parallel. These situations aren't problematic, but require somewhat different techniques to analyze.

\subsubsection{Kirchhoff's Laws}
\label{sssec:kirchoffsLaws}

\begin{definition}{Kirchhoff's Current Law}
  Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero:
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{N_{branch}} i_n = 0
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law}
  Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed path is zero:
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{m=1}^{M_{branch}} v_m = 0
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
