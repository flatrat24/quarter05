\section{Basic Laws}
\label{sec:basicLaws}

\subsection{Ohm's Law}
\label{ssec:ohmsLaw}

\textbf{Ohm's Law} states that the voltage $V$ is \textit{directly} proportional to the current $I$ and resistance $R$ of a circuit.

\begin{formula}{Ohm's Law}
  \begin{equation*}
    V = IR
  \end{equation*}
  Where:
  \begin{equation*}
    R = \rho \cdot \frac{l}{A}
  \end{equation*}
\end{formula}

When there is current flowing through a wire with resistance approaching zero, a \textbf{short circuit} is created. Conversely, an \textbf{open circuit} is where the resistance in a circuit approaches infinity.

Whereas resistance measures how much something impedes the flow of current, \textbf{conductance} is the ability of an element of conduct electric current; it is measured in mhos ($\mho$) or siemens ($S$).

\subsubsection{Resistivity}
\label{sssec:resistivity}

\begin{definition}{Resistivity ($\rho$)}
  A value representing the amount a material conducts electricity. Most metals tend to have high conductivity, while rubber has a low conductivity.
\end{definition}

The resistance $\si{R}$ of a wire, for example, is a value to varies with the inherent properties as well as the dimensions of the wire and its materials. The inherent properties of a material as they relate to resistance are codified as a material's \textbf{resistivity}.

\subsection{Nodes, Branches, and Loops}
\label{ssec:nodesBranchesLoops}

\begin{definition}{Branch $(b)$}
  Represents a single element in a circuit such as a resistor or power supply.
\end{definition}

\begin{wrapfigure}[7]{l}{0.35\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/fig_007}
  \caption{Nodes and Branches}
  \label{fig:007}
\end{wrapfigure}

In Figure \ref{fig:007}, there exist \textit{five} branches in the circuit. Specifically, there are three resistors, one voltage source, and one current source:
\begin{equation*}
  3 + 1 + 1 = 5
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}{Node ($n$)}
  The point of connection between two or more branches.
\end{definition}

In the same circuit (\ref{fig:007}), there are three nodes. Each node is highlighted in a different color. Notice that there are no branches within a node, thus each node is the largest area possible without crossing a branch. Furthermore, the voltage throughout an ideal node is zero.

\begin{definition}{Loop ($l$)}
  A loop is any \textit{closed} path in a circuit. Generally, loops are defined as the smallest possible path.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includestandalone{figures/fig_008}
  \caption{Loops}
  \label{fig:008}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-10pt}
Each shown in a different color in Figure \ref{fig:008}, loops are easy to visualize as the area enclosed by any closed series of components.

\begin{formula}{Network Topology}
  \begin{equation*}
    b = l + n - 1
  \end{equation*}
  \vspace{-17pt}
\end{formula}

\subsubsection{In Parallel vs. Series}
\label{sssec:inParallelVsSeries}

\begin{definition}{Series}
  Two or more elements are in series if they exclusively share a single node and consequently carry the same current.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[H]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includestandalone{figures/fig_009}
    \caption{Loops}
    \label{fig:009}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[H]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includestandalone{figures/fig_010}
    \caption{Loops}
    \label{fig:010}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{In Parallel and In Series}
  \label{fig:inParallelAndInSeries}
\end{figure}

Continuing with the same circuit, Figure \ref{fig:009} highlights elements in series. The only two elements in series are the voltage source and the top resistor.

Figure \ref{fig:010} highlights two of the three sets of parallel components. The third set would be the leftmost vertical resistor and the current source.

\begin{definition}{In Parallel}
  Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same two notes and consequently have the same voltage across them.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Kirchhoff's Laws}
\label{ssec:kirchoffsLaws}

\begin{definition}{Kirchhoff's Current Law}
  Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero:
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{N_{branch}} i_n = 0
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law}
  Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed path is zero:
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{m=1}^{M_{branch}} v_m = 0
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
